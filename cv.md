### About me ###
***
 I am a novice developer with experience in creating SPAs using _JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux._ 
 My goal is to become a full-stack developer. 
 Ability to work in a team and constant self-study, no problem finding common ground with people, also work well in a team. 
 I spend my free time learning _English_ with my tutor and _technical documentation._
